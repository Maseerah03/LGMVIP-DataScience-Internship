# Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset – Terrorism

This project was completed as part of my Data Science Internship at LetsGrowMore (October 2023 batch). The objective was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a global terrorism dataset to identify trends, regional patterns, and the frequency of attacks across different countries.

## Objective

To explore and visualize patterns in terrorism-related incidents using the Global Terrorism Database. The project focuses on identifying the most affected countries and regions, types of attacks, and casualty statistics through statistical summaries and visualizations.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python  
- pandas  
- numpy  
- seaborn  
- matplotlib

## Summary of Work

- Loaded and cleaned a publicly available dataset containing detailed records of global terrorist activities.
- Selected relevant columns including date, country, region, city, attack type, and casualty figures.
- Removed rows with missing values to ensure data consistency.
- Aggregated data by country and region to count the number of attacks.
- Visualized the top 20 most affected countries and summarized attack patterns across different global regions.

## Key Outcomes

- Successfully identified countries and regions with the highest number of terrorist incidents.
- Visualized trends in terrorism using bar plots and statistical summaries.
- Gained hands-on experience in data wrangling, grouping, and EDA using real-world data.
- Developed a deeper understanding of regional patterns in terrorist activities.

## Files Included

- `Exploratory_Data_Analysis_on_Dataset-Terrorism.ipynb` – Google Colab notebook with full code, analysis, and visualizations.
- `README.md` – Project summary and documentation.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, which is freely available to the public for research and analysis. Due to size and licensing considerations, the dataset is **not included** in this repository.
