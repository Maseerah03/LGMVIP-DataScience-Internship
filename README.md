# LetsGrowMore Data Science Internship Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository containing the projects I completed during my Data Science Internship with **LetsGrowMore (LGMVIP)** in October 2023.  
This internship gave me the opportunity to work on beginner, intermediate, and advanced level tasks in **Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and NLP**.

## Projects Overview

### Beginner-Level Projects
1. **Iris Flowers Classification**
   - Used supervised learning to classify iris flower species using features like sepal/petal length and width.
   - Tools: `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

2. **Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM**
   - Built a deep learning model using stacked LSTM layers to forecast stock prices.
   - Tools: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

3. **Image to Pencil Sketch with Python**
   - Converted images into pencil sketch format using OpenCV.
   - Tools: `OpenCV`, `NumPy`

### Intermediate-Level Projects
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset**
   - Performed EDA on a global terrorism dataset to find insights and trends.
   - Tools: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`

5. **Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm**
   - Built and visualized a decision tree classifier for prediction tasks.
   - Tools: `scikit-learn`, `Graphviz`, `matplotlib`

### Advanced-Level Projects
6. **Neural Network to Recognize Handwriting (MNIST Digit Recognition)**
   - Trained a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.
   - Tools: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`

7. **Next Word Prediction (NLP Project)**
   - Developed an LSTM-based language model to predict the next word in a given sentence.
   - Tools: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NLP preprocessing`
